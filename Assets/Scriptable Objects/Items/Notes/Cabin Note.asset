  description: "Day 37\n The laughter again.\nIt starts just after sunset\u2014light,
    playful, like a game is being played where no one should be.\nBut there hasn\u2019t
    been a child here in years.\nI opened the closet on Day 12. There was nothing.
    Just old coats and the stench of rotting sugar. But the air was cold... wrong.
    I tried to laugh back once.\n It laughed louder.\nOn Day 21, I saw something
    in the crack between the doors. Just a sliver of pale face and wide, glassy eyes.
    I didn't sleep that night.\nDay 26 \u2014 the laughter changed. It started mimicking
    me. The same cough, the same gasp. Like a recording played just half a second
    too late.\nI nailed the door shut yesterday. Covered it in salt.\nBut tonight\u2014tonight
    it\u2019s knocking.\nAnd the voice whispered,\n\u201CCome play, Charlie. I\u2019ve
    been so patient.\u201D\n"
