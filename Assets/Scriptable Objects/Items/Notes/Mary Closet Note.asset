  description: "He said it was rats.\nEvery night, like clockwork, the cries would
    start\u2014soft at first, like a child muffling sobs through cupped hands. Then
    scratching\u2026 then begging.\nI told White Winston. He laughed. Said \u201CYou\u2019ve
    got rats, girl. They scream sometimes. Natural.\u201D\nBut I saw him dig that
    hole beneath the floorboards last winter. I saw the way he covered it like a
    coffin. I saw the stains on his boots.\nThey weren\u2019t rats.\nLast night,
    one of them whispered my name.\nThey know I\u2019m listening now.\nAnd tonight\u2026
    the crying stopped.\nThe silence is worse."
