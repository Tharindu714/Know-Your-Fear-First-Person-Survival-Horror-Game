    asked.\nThey never came back.\nThe first night, I heard them clawing at the windows.\nBy
    the third, the forest whispered their names.\nNow, I see them. Pale. Hollow.
    Waiting.\nI warned the others, but greed is deaf.\n The contract is still open.\nIf
    you\u2019ve found this\u2014you\u2019re next in line."
